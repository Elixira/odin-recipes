    <h3>Delicious flaky pan fried salmon</h3>
    <p>This easy technique is the best way to perfectly pan-fry salmon at home. Start by looking for center-cut fillets that are about 1-inch thick (thinner pieces will cook quicker). Be sure to properly store your fish: if you bought it fresh then keep it wrapped in the paper from the grocery store and nestle it into ice cubes in the refrigerator. Let the salmon sit at room temperature for at least 10 minutes to take the chill off before cooking (it’s a chef’s secret). This little warm-up will help your fish cook more evenly. Be sure to use a nonstick pan so the fillets slide out nicely. Serve with your favorite prepared sauce or stretch the salmon by shredding it into pieces with a fork to add to salads and grain bowls.</p>
